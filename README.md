# Database-Project
Economic Management System for Handmade Jewelry Store

Description

This project focuses on creating a database to manage the daily operations of a handmade jewelry store. The store specializes in unique, high-quality jewelry crafted from materials like gold, silver and other metals. The goal of the database is to help the store keep track of its inventory, manage customer orders, handle relationships with suppliers and properly monitor employee activities.

The database includes tables to store information about jewelry items, materials used, and suppliers. It also keeps detailed records of customer orders, including the items ordered, quantities, and prices. To improve customer service, the database stores customer details like contact information and delivery addresses.

One of the key parts of the project is helping the store analyze its costs and profits. For example, the database calculates profit margins by comparing the selling price of an item to its material costs. Employee performance is also tracked by monitoring how many orders they manage.

The system also includes a feature for customers to leave reviews about the products. This helps the store understand customer satisfaction and make improvements where needed, and also makes customers feel like their opinion matters.

By using SQL to create, manipulate, and query the database, this project demonstrates how a database can help a small business like a jewelry store operate more efficiently and make better decisions for its future.
